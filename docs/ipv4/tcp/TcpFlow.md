 # TCP Connection

 Represents a TCP flow between a client and server socket address. The
 flow tracks sequence and acknowledgement numbers automatically.

 Use [open](#open) to perform the 3-way handshake and [client_close](#client_close) /
 [server_close](#server_close) for the FIN/ACK teardown.

 For data transfer there are three levels of abstraction:

 - [client_message](#client_message) / [server_message](#server_message) — emit a data
   segment and automatically follow it with an ACK from the other side. This is the
   highest-level option and covers most use cases.
 - [client_segment](#client_segment) / [server_segment](#server_segment) — emit a single
   data segment with no auto-ACK. Use when you need fine-grained control over ACK timing
   or want to interleave segments from both sides manually.
 - [client_raw_segment](#client_raw_segment) / [server_raw_segment](#server_raw_segment) —
   return TCP header + payload as raw bytes (no IP or Ethernet framing). Use with
   [`ipv4::frag`](../README.md#frag) to build IP-fragmented TCP segments.

 [client_hdr](#client_hdr) / [server_hdr](#server_hdr) go one step further and return
 only the TCP header bytes, for cases where the header and payload must land in separate
 IP fragments. [client_hole](#client_hole) / [server_hole](#server_hole) advance the
 sequence number without emitting any packet, simulating a missing segment for
 reassembly test cases.

### Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| [client_ack](#client_ack) | `Pkt` | Sends an ACK from the client |
| [client_close](#client_close) | `PktGen` | Shutdown both sides of the TCP connection, with the client sending the first FIN |
| [client_hdr](#client_hdr) | `bytes` | Returns a TCP header only (no payload, no IP header) for a client-to-server segment, as `bytes`. The optional `bytes` argument declares how many payload bytes the header should account for in the sequence number, without actually emitting them. Use with `ipv4::frag` to craft fragmented packets where the TCP header lands in one fragment and the payload in another. |
| [client_hole](#client_hole) | `void` | Creates a hole in the sever's Tx sequence space, making it look like we missed a packet from the client |
| [client_message](#client_message) | `PktGen` | Sends a message from client to server, advancing the sequence number. By default also emits an ACK from the server in response (`send_ack: true`). Use `send_ack: false` to suppress the ACK, for example when building out-of-order or reassembly test cases. |
| [client_raw_segment](#client_raw_segment) | `bytes` | Returns TCP header + payload bytes only (no Ethernet or IP header) for a client-to-server segment, advancing the sequence number. Returns `bytes` rather than `Pkt`. Use this with `ipv4::frag` to build IP-fragmented TCP segments. |
| [client_reset](#client_reset) | `Pkt` | Send a RST packet from the client |
| [client_segment](#client_segment) | `Pkt` | Returns a single data segment from client to server, advancing the sequence number. Does not emit an ACK. Returns a `Pkt` (complete Ethernet+IP+TCP packet) rather than a `PktGen`. |
| [open](#open) | `PktGen` | Performs a TCP 3-way handshake |
